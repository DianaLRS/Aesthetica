# Aesthetica

## Description
Aesthetica is a mobile responsive, interactive app that bridges fashion and community. Users can build a unique profile secured with a username and password. We tackle the hassle of filtering products based on userâ€™s shopping preferences which can then be pinned to their profile. Aesthetica stands out amongst its competitors by adding a community. Users can talk to like-minded shoppers by leaving comments on their posts.
